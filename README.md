# Sight Reading Exercise Generator
SREGen is a project I decided to undertake when I started to play the
piano more often again, and realized that I am a horrible sight reader.
Ultimately, I hope that SREGen would be able to successfully generate
sight reading exercises whose difficulty can be controlled, and at the same
time, sound musical by following the rules set by music theory.

## Progress
Currently working on how elements of music (notes, key signature, rhythm,
etc.) can be internally represented.

# Tentative Project Plan
  1. **Internal representation of musical concepts**
  2. Writing voices onto a pdf file
  3. Harmony generation
  4. Bass line generation
  5. Two-part music
  6. Four-part music generation
  7. Ornamentation
  8. Construction of complex music from four-part music
