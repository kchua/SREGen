# Sight Reading Exercise Generator
SREGen is a project I decided to undertake when I started to play the
piano more often again, and realized that I am a horrible sight reader.
Ultimately, I hope that SREGen would be able to successfully generate
sight reading exercises whose difficulty can be controlled, and at the same
time, sound musical by following the rules set by music theory.

## Progress
In the process of determining how notes would be written onto a Lilypond
file; will probably take a detour and make a program that prints scales
to check correctness of the program so far.

## Tentative Project Plan
  1. Internal representation of notes and scales
  2. **Writing voices onto a pdf file**
  3. Internal representation of other musical concepts (chords, progressions)
  4. Creation of genetic algorithm template
  5. Harmony generation
  6. Bass line generation
  7. Two-part music
  8. Four-part music generation
  9. Ornamentation
  10. Construction of complex music from four-part music
